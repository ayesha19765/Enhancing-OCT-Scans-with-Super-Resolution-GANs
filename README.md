Got it, let's remove the reference to `requirements.txt` and provide explicit installation instructions for the dependencies. Here's the revised README:

# SR-GANs for Medical Image

Super-resolution generative adversarial networks (SR-GANs) are advanced deep learning models designed to enhance the quality of low-resolution medical images. This repository provides the necessary code and data to implement SR-GANs for medical image processing, which can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and detail in clinical settings.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SR-GANs code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mmasdar/SR-GANs-for-Medical-Image.git
    ```
2. **Install the required dependencies listed in the Prerequisites section.**
3. **Run the code with your preferred parameters.**

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.13.0 or higher
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, use the following commands:
```bash
pip install torch==1.13.0
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

To run the SR-GAN model on your data, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset:**
   - Split your dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Configure the model parameters:**
   - Edit the configuration file to set your model parameters and paths.

3. **Train the model:**
   - Use the training dataset to train the model.

4. **Evaluate the model:**
   - Use the testing dataset to evaluate the model's performance.

5. **Run the model:**
   - Execute the model on new data to generate high-resolution images.

### Commands

Here is an example of how to use the SR-GAN model:

```python
import torch
from model import SRGAN
from dataset import MedicalImageDataset

# Load dataset
train_dataset = MedicalImageDataset(train_data_path)
test_dataset = MedicalImageDataset(test_data_path)

# Initialize model
model = SRGAN()

# Train model
model.train(train_dataset)

# Evaluate model
results = model.evaluate(test_dataset)

# Display results
model.display(results)
```

## Model Details

The SR-GAN model consists of two main components:

1. **Generator Network:** Upscales low-resolution images to high-resolution images.
2. **Discriminator Network:** Differentiates between real high-resolution images and generated images, guiding the generator to produce more realistic images through adversarial training.

This approach leverages the strengths of both networks to produce high-quality, high-resolution medical images from low-resolution inputs.

## Example

Here is an example workflow:

1. **Load your medical images dataset.**
2. **Train the SR-GAN model on the training set.**
3. **Evaluate the model on the testing set.**
4. **Generate and visualize the enhanced images.**
